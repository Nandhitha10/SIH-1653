## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
This project requires developing a Web-Based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software to create an objective and unbiased interview process for RAC under DRDO. The software should simulate a real-life Board Room experience and provide a quantifiable scoring system for both interviewers (question relevance) and candidates (response relevance).

Key Functional Requirements:
User Roles & Authentication:

Admin: Manages users, questions, and configurations.
Interviewers (Experts): Pose questions and evaluate candidates.
Candidates: Answer questions and receive scores.
Board Room Simulation:

Virtual panel interview with structured questions.
Ice-breaking questions followed by techno-managerial queries.
Voice & text-based responses for a real-time experience.
Question-Answer Relevance Scoring:

Questions dynamically suggested based on candidate expertise.
Experts rate the relevance of answers given by candidates.
AI/NLP-based automatic scoring system for responses.
Scoring Mechanism:

Relevancy score for questions (Expert evaluation).
Relevancy score for answers (Manual/AI-based grading).
Overall suitability score calculated for final assessment.
Interview Analytics & Reports:

Individual candidate performance report.
Comparative analysis of candidates.
Dashboard for real-time insights.
